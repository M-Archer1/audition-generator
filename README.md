# Mixed Messages - Audition Generator

## Project Description
I created this as part of the Mixed Messages portfolio project in the Codecademy Back-End Career Path.  The goal was to create a JavaScript project that would display some form of random message based on at least three different pieces of data.

I decided to create a program that could help with live music auditions.  Often in live band and orchestra auditions a contestant will be required to play certain scales and etudes, and the judge is required to select these at random from a predetermined list.

This webpage will generate a random scale and sight-reading etude for each contestant.  The judge can click "Next Audition" to move to the next candidate.
